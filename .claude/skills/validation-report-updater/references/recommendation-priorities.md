# Recommendation Priority Guidelines

## High Priority Recommendations

High priority recommendations typically include:

- **Critical structural issues**: Missing frontmatter, incorrect file structure, broken functionality
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Issues that could expose system to risks
- **Core functionality problems**: Issues that prevent the skill from working as intended
- **Major compliance issues**: Violations of standards or requirements
- **Performance issues**: Problems that significantly impact efficiency

### Examples of High Priority Actions:
- Adding missing YAML frontmatter to SKILL.md
- Fixing broken links or references
- Correcting security misconfigurations
- Implementing required validation checks

## Medium Priority Recommendations

Medium priority recommendations typically include:

- **Usability improvements**: Better user interaction patterns, clearer instructions
- **Maintainability enhancements**: Code organization, documentation improvements
- **Workflow optimizations**: Better process flows, more efficient procedures
- **Integration improvements**: Better connections with other tools/components

### Examples of Medium Priority Actions:
- Adding clarification questions
- Improving documentation sections
- Enhancing error handling
- Adding cross-references

## Low Priority Recommendations

Low priority recommendations typically include:

- **Enhancement suggestions**: Additional features or capabilities
- **Polish improvements**: Styling, formatting, minor refinements
- **Future considerations**: Ideas for future expansion
- **Nice-to-have additions**: Extra functionality that's not critical

### Examples of Low Priority Actions:
- Adding more examples
- Including additional references
- Fine-tuning wording
- Adding troubleshooting sections

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order:
1. Address all high priority items first
2. Tackle medium priority items next
3. Consider low priority items last
4. Document any items that are deferred with reasons

### Tracking Implementation:
- Use [COMPLETED] for fully implemented recommendations
- Use [PARTIALLY COMPLETED] for items that were addressed but not fully implemented
- Use [PENDING] for items that were not addressed with reasons
- Update validation reports to reflect the current status of each recommendation
